    <p class="narrow-paragraph">Hey everyone! Allow me to introduce myself. I come from the country Haiti, and the moment I found out about pickleball, I fell in love with it and will never turn down an opportunity to play a game. I've been married to my stunning wife for almost 2 years now and we got married in the Meridian temple. I am getting into physical therapy, though, I also do real estate on the side. Here comes my subtle plug, IF ANY OF YOU, OR ANYONE YOU KNOW, ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING/SELLING WITHIN THE STATE OF IDAHO, LET ME KNOW. Other than that, I am a fairly laid back kinda guy.</p>
