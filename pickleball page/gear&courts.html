                                Balls, Shoes, & Essentials Not all balls behave the same, and the right shoes keep you comfortable and reduce injury risk. This paragraph covers indoor vs. outdoor balls, the traction and lateral support you want in shoes, and small accessories (grip tape, vibration dampeners, a court bag) that make play easier.

                                The basic rules of pickleball include serving diagonally from behind the baseline, the double-bounce rule (the ball must bounce once on each side after the serve before anyone can volley), and the rule against volleying in the non-volley zone (the "kitchen"). Points are scored only by the serving team, and games are typically played to 11, win by two.

                                Community & Local Resources Finally, we encourage players to connect: post meetup notices, share tips in the forum, or sign up for beginner clinics listed on a local event calander. The social side of pickleball is huge, the friends you make are often the reason players keep coming back, and this page helps those connections happen quickly and easily.
